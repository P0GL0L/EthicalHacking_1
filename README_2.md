## 🎯 What Is This Course?

**Certified Ethical Hacking I** is a complete curriculum designed to take someone with **no prior security experience** through the entire penetration testing methodology. By the end, you'll have the skills to perform professional security assessments and pursue industry certifications.

This course emphasizes:
- **Hands-on practice** over theory memorization
- **Ethical foundations** before technical skills
- **Professional methodology** from day one
- **Real-world applicability** in every lesson

## 🛡️ Course Philosophy

> "You cannot effectively attack networks you don't understand."

This curriculum builds knowledge **layer by layer**:

1. **Legal and ethical foundations first** — Understand the rules before you play
2. **Networking fundamentals** — Know how data travels before intercepting it
3. **Reconnaissance** — Find targets before attacking them
4. **Scanning and enumeration** — Understand systems before exploiting them
5. **Exploitation** — Apply knowledge systematically
6. **Post-exploitation** — Demonstrate real impact
7. **Professional practice** — Report findings that drive change
